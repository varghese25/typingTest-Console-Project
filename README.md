Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
Installation and Setup
Download and Install JDK: Ensure you have JDK 8 or higher installed. You can download it from the Oracle website.
Set Up IDE: Install and set up an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
Create a New Project: Create a new Java project in your IDE.
Add the appTypetest Class: Create a new Java class named appTypetest and copy the provided code into this class.
Usage
Run the Program: Execute the appTypetest class in your IDE.
Type the Prompt: The application will display a sentence for you to type.
View Results: After typing the sentence, the application will display the time taken, the number of correct words, the number of incorrect words, and your typing speed in words per minute (WPM).



Key Points:
Prompt and Timer: The program starts by displaying a sentence and recording the start time.
User Input: It then waits for the user to type the sentence.
Time Calculation: The end time is recorded, and the total time taken is calculated.
Word Comparison: The program splits the sentences into words and compares them to count correct and incorrect words.
Typing Speed Calculation: The typing speed in words per minute (WPM) is calculated.
Result Display: Finally, the program displays the results.
Results
The results displayed by the application include:

Time Taken: The total time in seconds taken to type the sentence.
Words Typed Correctly: The number of words typed correctly.
Words Typed Incorrectly: The number of words typed incorrectly.
Typing Speed: The typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
Future Enhancements
Potential improvements to the application could include:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Adding a GUI to make the application more user-friendly.
Dynamic Sentences: Allowing the program to randomly select sentences from a pool.
Detailed Error Analysis: Providing more detailed feedback on which words were incorrect.
Multiple Tests: Enabling the user to take multiple tests and track progress over time.
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Typing Speed Test Application, covering its functionality, usage, and potential areas for enhancement.
